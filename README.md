A gentle introduction to Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) on Bitcoin

## What is a DLC?

DLCs offer a way to implement financial smart contracts on Bitcoin and what is more I believe they could also be used directly between peers on Lightning.

The technical part was presented in a talk on the second [Bitcoin Ljubljana meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-ljubljana/) 16.9.2021 but since then this has already evolved a bit and with your help it will continue to become more comprehensible.

## Outline

First we need go through some [Eliptic Curve Cryptography Basics](ecc101.md). Then we tackle [Schnorr Signature Scheme](./schnorr.md) and finally explain [Discreet Log Contracts](./dlc.md).

You might want to check out the [FAQ](./faq.md) as well.

There is also a silly explanation using analogies [A story about betting and self-driving robots](./story.md)
